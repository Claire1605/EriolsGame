TO DO:

- can drag car off the screen
- can click through text quickly
- where does the door image go?
- missing image of paramedic and eriol in car


Suggestions:
- different icon for next button if it's a new page next? .. probably not necessary really
- Arrow controls as well as click? (move from section to section, page to page)
- Is the more info you get from popups in-game or a URL?


IMPORTANT - need to fix if extendable - the popup setactive will probably not work if there is only ONE popup in Interactive Sprites - test

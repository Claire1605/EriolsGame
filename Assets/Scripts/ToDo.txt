TO DO:

- Put all images in story manager
- Add pop-up sections
- format carriage returns
- ending/remove next button?


Suggestions:
- different icon for next button if it's a new page next? .. probably not necessary really
- Arrow controls as well as click? (move from section to section, page to page)
- Is the more info you get from popups in-game or a URL?


Popups:

- Asset to click on
-
